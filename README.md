# Abstract
Magic Kingdom, at Walt Disney World in Orlando Florida, has lived up to its tagline as being "The most Magical Place on Earth" by becoming one of the most visited theme parks in the world. According to the Themed Entertainment Association Global Attractions Attendance Report in 2015, Walt Disney's Magic Kingdom hosted over 20 million vistors. (http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_160_611852_160525.pdf). For anyone who has the visited Magic Kingdom theme park, the size of the crowds can affect guests' overall experience and impose safety issues. Compounding this issue is the bottleneck created by the Transportation and Ticket Center (TTC) where guests must take the water ferry, monorail or bus to get to the official main street entrance to Magic Kingdom. The goal of our system is to model the time it would take guests to arrive at Magic Kingdom based on which mode of transportation taken from the TTC.

## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
As stated above, Disney's tagline for the Magic Kingdom is "The most Magical Place on Earth" and Disney has done its best to make this tagline a reality in its parks.  However, as with many companies who grow in size it, its success has exposed failings in its initial design concept.  The official entrance to Magic Kingdom was resticted in its design to one of three ways: from the Magic Kingdom parking lot: Monorail, Bus and Water Ferry.  While this helps visitors to leave the trappins of the real world behind and enter the magical park, it creates a bottlneck during heavy traffic times at the park.  The design cannot effectively handle the massive amount of people who visit the Magic Kindom each year, which is on the order of over 20 million people.  Each days thousands of people must get onto a bus, ferry or monorial to get to the park and cannot walk to it from their car.  Each mode has an OHSA determined number of people that can safely be transported from the TTC to the park entrance.  While the monorail, ferry and buses run continously throughout the day, it can take upwards of an hour to get from the Magic Kingdom Parking lot to the Magic Kingdom entrance.  This could lead to up to 2 hours of a day at the park used that could have been spent riding rides, meeting Mickey and his friend or chowind down on some good Disney eats.  

A big motivation for the project is determine what is the most time effective route to get form the TTC to the Magic Kingdom ENtrance and from the Magic Kindom Entrance to the TTC.  This study will help each group memeber and their families when they go to the park to know what route to take depending on the time of day.  It could also help Disney to determine if new routes or modes of getting to Magic Kingdom from teh parking lot are needed to help make the experience less stressfull and more magical.  Maybe flying Dragons could work but we will wait until the project is over to make that determination.

(Add real-world examples, if any)

Among the four group memebers, all 4 have been to at least one of the Disney Parks and 3 of the 4 have been to Magic Kingdom and have at one time or another taken the monorail, ferry or bus.  Adam states that when leaving Magic Kingdom after the fire works that the buses are the quickest way to get out of the park and beat the crowds.  Mike usually prefers to take the monorail to and from the park, and at times even take the resort monorail to avoid the crowds.  The ferry, while it can hold the most people per trip, appears to be the slowest route but this has not been confirmed with data only coloqially through experience.


(You should begin by introducing your topic. In this section, you should define the core terminology specific to the field, introduce the problem statement, and make clear the benefits (motivate!) of resolving that problem statement. The main difference between the ABSTRACT and Introduction sections is that the abstract summarizes the entire project, including results, whereas the introduc-tion only provides the motivation of the problem and an overview of the proposed solution.)

(I tell sutdents to answer the questions, one paragaph each to start if you are lost)

(Problem Statement. One paragraph to describe the prob-lem that you are tackling.)

(Motivation. Why is this problem interesting and relevant to the research community?)

(Proposed Solution. How do we propose to tackle this problem (that has been identified in the previous para-graphs, is interesting to the community, and has yet to be tackled by other researchers)?)

(Contributions. An enumeration of the contributions of the senior design project)

(This project makes the following contributions:)(you must have this!!)
•	(Contribution 1)
•	(Contribution 2)



## The Model

(Provide structural and behavior diagrams of the system you wish to study.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?) (Use the model to tell us what is going on.)

(explicitly list your requirements of what the model will have and simulate for the proposal)

## Fundamental Questions
(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions) (Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )

## Expected Results
(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?) (This changes from Expected (Proposal) to just Results (final report)) (you should verbally define them) (sketch a few graphs of what you are roughly going for - not the data but histogram of this, line graph of that, screenshot of an agent - use paper and pencil sketches)

## Research Methods
(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Discrete Event Continuous Modeling...)(Python or Anylogic) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards) (Steps in the process)

## (Other)
(change the title and amount of headers as needed) (mention datasets you are going to use) (mention base code or examples you)

## Discussion
(final only - remove whole section for proposal Readme) (What would you have done differently) (What are the contributions summerize)(what is the big take away)(what did you learn)

## Future Work
(final only - remove whole section for proposal Readme) (if you had 6 more months what would be the next steps in this project.) (What are a few questions you have now)

## References
(Add the bibliographic references you intend to use)  (Code / Projects / blogs / websites / papers...)
